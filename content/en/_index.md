      title: '📚 My Research and Work'
      subtitle: ''
      text: |-
        Fascinated with the science behind the mystic teachings, Sandra operates with one foot in academia and the other one in the realm of spirituality. In her work she combines modern knowledge of the physical body with the ancient wisdoms of energy work in private sessions, group classes, retreats and lectures. Read more about her work here.
        
        As a sceptic and a believer, Sandra questions the structures of our modern society as well as the intangible concept of spirituality but nevertheless loving them both.
        
        Through her mission she wishes to deepen spiritual practices using scientific answers as well as broaden the views of academic research with a deep humbleness towards the unexplainable divine, bridging the two worlds together. Read her professional bio here.

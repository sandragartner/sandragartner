abstract: Background - One in four cancer patients use complementary and alternative medicine CAM in Sweden. Despite patients interest and needs, there is limited quality-assured information about CAM available, driving the patients to seek outside of the state funded healthcare system for guidance. Even though health communication and health information are a fundamental part of public health there is little consensus on the methodologies used within the field to meet target group demands. Aim To explore the needs of women affected by cancer for evidence-based health information about CAM and cancer. Method Participants for this study were women affected by cancer that partook in health information lectures provided by Regional Cancer Centre RCC about CAM and cancer. Data was collected through qualitative research design using face-to-face individual interviews conducted both physically and online. Data analysis was done with an inductive approach using a qualitative content analysis method extracting meaning units from the transcribed interviews that aligned with the research aim. The meaning units were condensed into shorter versions that were labeled with a code, which in turn was grouped into sub-categories and categories. Result Three overarching categories and six sub-categories were found. Health information needs for women affected by cancer for CAM and cancer was To be empowered (category 1), Accessible and understandable information (category 2\) and Communications with health care professionals (category 3). *Conclusion* It is essential to understand health information needs of women affected by cancer to provide tailored messages that could meet the demand of the target group. If the information is presented in an accessible and understandable way it may empower women affected by cancer to make informed decisions about ways to support their health and help foster a safe communication about CAM with healthcare professionals.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: In Sweden, where one in four cancer patients use complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), women affected by cancer lack sufficient evidence-based information, prompting them to seek guidance outside the healthcare system. A qualitative study interviewing women who attended Regional Cancer Centre lectures identified three key needs empowerment through knowledge, accessible and understandable information, and improved communication with healthcare professionals. Tailored, high-quality CAM information can empower these women to make informed decisions and foster safer dialogues with providers.
